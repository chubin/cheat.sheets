# cheat.sheets

Own cheat sheets repository of the *cheat.sh*.

If you want to add a cheat sheet to cheat.sh directly,
add it here (please also consider adding your cheat sheet
to one of the upstream repositories).

```
# Command name
# Short command description

# Command usage example1 started with some comments
# and followed with a command example/switches.
command1

# Command usage example2.
# Each block separated with an empty line.
command2
```

For example:

```
# curl
# Command-line tool for transferring data with URL syntax

# Process a single GET request, and show its output on stdout.
curl http://path.to.the/file
```

Requirements and constraints:

* Maximum length of a comment line (including comment sign) is 80
