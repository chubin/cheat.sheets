# Show only a given value from one of the `show` keys. In this example, the
# value for the `ActiveState` key for the UFW service will be shown, and only
# it; ideal for scripting.

# Using the `--value` flag causes only the value to be displayed.

# Start, stop, or restart a given service(s).
systemctl [start|stop|restart] [SERVICE]

# Check if a given service(s) is active. If it is, 'active' will display. An
# exit status of 0 will be given if it's active, and non-zero otherwise. Use
# the `-q` or `--quiet` flag to rely only on the exit status.
systemctl is-active ufw

# Check if a given service(s) has failed. If it is, 'failed' will display. An
# exit status of 0 will be given if it has failed, and non-zero otherwise. Use
