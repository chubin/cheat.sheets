# ssh
# OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)

# SSH in via PEM file, which normally needs 0600 permissions.
ssh -i /path/to/file.pem user@example.com

# Connect through a non-standard port. It's recommended not to use the default
# port of 22, as it is so often targeted, due to it being so commonplace.
ssh -p 2222 user@example.com

# Connect and forward the authentication agent.
ssh -A user@example.com

# Execute a command on a remote server.
ssh -t user@example.com 'the-remote-command'

# Tunnel an X session over SSH, via X11 Forwarding.
ssh -X user@example.com

# Redirect traffic with a tunnel between local host (port 8080) and a remote
# host (remote.example.com:5000) through a proxy (personal.server.com).
ssh -f -L 8080:remote.example.com:5000 user@personal.server.com -N

# Launch a specific X application over SSH.
ssh -X -t user@example.com 'chromium-browser'

# Create a SOCKS proxy on localhost and port 9999.
ssh -D 9999 user@example.com

# Connect to server, but allow for X11 forwarding, while also using GZip
# compression (can be much faster; YMMV), and using the `blowfish` encryption.
# For more information, see: http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/12755/44856
ssh -XCc blowfish user@example.com

# Copy files and directories, via SSH, from remote host to the current working
# directory, with GZip compression. An option for when `rsync` isn't available.

# This works by creating (not temporary!) a remote Tar archive, then piping its
# output to a local Tar process, which then extracts it to STDOUT.

# Explicitly specify a key for connection. Useful if you have too many
# authentication failures for a given username.
ssh -i some_id_rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes them@there:/path/

# Temporarily disable `pubkey` authentication for this instance.
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no username@hostname.com

# Mount a remote directory or filesystem, through SSH, to a local mountpoint.
