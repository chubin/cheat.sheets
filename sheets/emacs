# More general
    M-x outline-minor-mode
                collapses function definitions in a file to a mere {...}
    M-x show-subtree
                If you are in one of the collapsed functions, this un-collapses it
# In order to achieve some of the feats coming up,
# now you have to run etags *.c *.h *.cpp
# (or what ever ending you source files have) in the source directory
    M-.         (Meta dot) If you are in a function call, this will take you to it\'s definition
    M-x tags-search ENTER
                Searches through all you etaged
    M-,         (Meta comma) jumps to the next occurence for tags-search
    M-x tags-query-replace yum.
                This lets you replace some text in all the tagged files
