# Expand a regular variable.
$Var
# Some people like to cuddle the variable name with braces ('{' and '}') but
# this is usually superfluous and wasted keystrokes, unless you need to protect
# the variable name from having other characters included, as in the below
# example, or you're using one of the many features of parameter expansion.
"${Var}some text"

# Access a given index in an array. In this example, you don't technically
# need to specify the element, because by default the first element is used.
# As with many other languages, note that indices are 0-first, so 1 is the 2nd.
${Var[0]}
# You can use arithmetic between '[' and ']' as well.
${Var[2+3]}

# Expand variable to the length of that to which the variable would expand.
${#Var}

# Expand array variable to the number of elements/indices. You may find that
# `[*]` works as well as `[@]`, in this case.
${#Var[@]}

# Expand variable to a substring. In this case, imagine `Var` is equal to the
# string 'thing', but the offset is 2 and the length is 1, giving us an 'i'.
${Var:2:1}

# Expand variable to a substring by removing the matched glob pattern from left
# to right. To make this global (IE: greedy) use two '#' characters. So, in
# this example, everything, from left to right, up to and including a 'T' or
# 't', will be removed, but it would only happen once.
${Var#*[Tt]}
# As above, but from right to left. Use two '%' characters for a greedy match.
${Var%[Tt]*}

# Change how the variable expands by using pattern substitution. This uses glob
# pattern matching, not REGEX. If the first '/' is instead '//', a greedy match
# is performed.
${Var/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/}
# A good example of the above, which will list directories in PATH which exist
# and are directories. It works because all instances of ':' are replaced with
# a whitespace, causing find(1) to see multiple directories (fields) in which
# to search.
find ${PATH//:/ } -type d

# Expand the variable to the string between `:-` and the closing `}`, if that
# variable doesn't already have a value. This can be useful to set a default.
${Var:-Default Value}

# This is a way of displaying an error message if the contents of the variable
# is empty. It will also immediately exit with an exit status of 1.
${Var:?This is an error message.}

# Indirect expansion exists in a couple of ways in BASH. If `Var` is equal to
# `OtherVar`, and that `OtherVar` is equal to `true`, the below example would
# expand to `true`.
${!Var}

# Expand variable so that the first letter is uppercase. Use two '^' (carets)
# if you want the entire contents of the variable to change to uppercase.
${Var^}
# As above, but convert to lowercase. Use two ',' characters to transform the
# entire string to which `Var` expands.
${Var,}
