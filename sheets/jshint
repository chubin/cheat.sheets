# jshint
# JSHint is a fork of JSLint. The reasons for the fork is basically that
# the author disagrees in some points with Douglas Crockford
# on JavaScript coding style.
#
# If you're looking for a very high standard for yourself or team,
# use JSLint (by Doug Crockford).
# If you want to be a bit more flexible, or have some old pros on your team
# that don't buy into JSLint's opinions, try JSHint.

# to install jshint
sudo npm install jshint -g

# lint all the JavaScript files in the current directory:
find . -name '*.js' -print0 | xargs -0 jshint

# lint all the JavaScript files in a targeted directory:
find ./public/javascripts/ -name '*.js' -print0 | xargs -0 jshint

# Parameter-less options passed to jslint are all set to true by default,
# if you want to set it false, just specify 'false' after the option
jshint --bitwise false hello.js
