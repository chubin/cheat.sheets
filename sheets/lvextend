# Extend volume in volume mylv in groug vg0
# (defined by volume path /dev/vg0/mylv)
# by 1 gigabyte:
lvextend -L +1G /dev/vg0/mylv

# Extend volume in volume mylv in groug vg0
# (defined by volume path /dev/vg0/mylv)
# to use all of the unallocated space in the volume group vg0:
lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg0/mylv

# Extend ext4 filesystem after changing a logical volume
# (takes volume path as parameter):
ext2resize /dev/vg0/mylv

# Extend btrfs filesystem after changing a logical volume
# (takes the mount point as parameter, not the volume path):

# Extend xfs filesystem after changing a logical volume
# (takes the mount point as parameter, not the volume path):
xfs_growfs /mylv
