# apk is the tool used to install, upgrade, or delete software
# on a running system of Alpine Linux package management

# To enable local APK cache run
setup-apkcache

# If you've installed Alpine to your hard drive (as 'sys'),
# then create a cache dir and then an /etc/apk/cache symlink
# pointing to that dir:
mkdir -p /var/cache/apk
ln -s /var/cache/apk /etc/apk/cache
